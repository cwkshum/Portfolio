	    		<hr>
	    		<p>For this project, I worked in a team of two with the SEEDA company to develop a front-end website 
					for their SeeRem division. The objective of the project was to design and build a functioning website 
					for SeeRem to allow their customers to learn more about the SeeRem application and to connect with the 
					sales team. By communicating with the company, I was able to learn more about the service they were offering 
					to help my partner and I better design for the intended purpose of the website. The end product was a fully 
					developed front-end responsive website to promote SeeRem, an application that allows teams working in remote 
					worksites to connect with one another.</p>

	    		<p>Overall, the whole process took two months and the website was coded to be responsive on a variety of devices and browsers. Although we were able to showcase the necessary information to promote SeeRem on a front-end website, I would like to explore the possibility of developing the back-end portion of the site in the future to handle user data. Using the experience from this project, I would spend more time considering how future website projects would look on mobile to make the process of implementing responsiveness easier. The final website was submitted to the company, where it received a positive review from Seeda.</p>
